Full spots, Live action, VFX, all types of animation, mixed media. Unique. Fun. Commercial, Broadcast, Music Video, Short &amp; Long format.
I am a Director | Executive Creative Director with Extensive and diversified background in Visual FX, Digital Stop-Motion, FX and every type of Animation, coupled with "outside-the-box approach", for marrying live action with visual FX. I come from the world(s) of Production and Post, primarily in Advertising and Broadcast, along with Feature films a number of years back. Based on this diverse experience I am very comfortable driving the creative; in both shepherding teams of talent (I have led teams from 10 to 200, both on site and virtually around the world), and managing clients, throughout the process of any project.


My national experiences ranges from several years at RGA, to even more at Click 3x, amongst other shops, with international experience working / living in Dubai, South Africa, and relationships with shops in Spain, Argentina in addition to China and India.


My work ranges from live action, to every kind of animation, and VFX. 


Here’s a link to my general reel:

Yes, while my current reel is geared towards funkier / mixed media work; that was intentional. Everything comes in cycles so I know that I have to stand out from what is commonly expected with practical examples of mine that are unique; and shops that create this type of work are extremely limited. I take pride in being ahead of the curve with the cyclical nature of certain styles and the “old-skool” organic approach of “created by hand and not solely by a machine” is becoming increasingly popular yet again. That’s specifically why my current Directorial reel is presented this way, however that’s not to say I don’t do CG, compositing, tracking, and VFX, or, more “polished seamless work” as well. In regard to projects of this nature, the following is an additional link to a montage presenting samples I have created with shops here in the States, and those from elsewhere around the globe.
